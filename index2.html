    my degree to computer science with my masters in robotics. I lived with

                    <img class="round" src="image/computer.jpg" with="300" height="230">
                      <p>When it comes to computer, I manily focus on old school Computers
                        I love them when you learn BASIC programming to govern the 
                        computer. I saw those types in sci-fi films such Alien(1979),
                        Blade Runner, Short Circuit, and other sci fi in the 70s or 80s.
                          </p>

                 <h3>Economics</h3>
                 <img class="round" src="image/Bitcoin.jpg" With="300" height="230">
                 <p>I got instered in economics when the Argentinan economist; Javier Milei
                    became the president. He helped Argentina store the economics without the 
                    goverment help, no rent control, no inflation, and people with a programing
                    experience gets a better salary. That got me instered so I buy a lot of books
                    about economics, the history, influencers, and the basics. And hope to learn it
                    better.
