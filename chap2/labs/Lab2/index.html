<main><p>Welcome to wild Rescues. Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate,
and release wildlife back into their natural environment. We are a
nonprofit organization dedicated to helping injured wildlife.</p>

also provide long-term care for wildlife that cannot be released back 
into their natural environment.</p>

<p>Will you partner with us? We need caring volunteers to help care 
for our animals. You can also donate, become a member, or become a
sponsor. Contact us today.</p></main>
