 <h2>CSS Working Group<h2>
 <p>The CSS Working Group, part of the W3C, sets the standards 
 for CSS. The group meets on a regular basis to update the standards. 
 Many of these documents are known as working drafts.</p>
 
 <p>Instead of releasing CSS versions, such as CSS 1 and 2, the
 group has charnged its approach for CSS updates. The CSS Working
 Group has broken CSS into modules to define parts of CSS. The 
 group now publishes CSS Snapshots, which include the latest updates to
 CSS. The group intends to publish these snapshot every one to two years.
 The latest CSS Snapshot is CSS Snapshot 2018.</p>
